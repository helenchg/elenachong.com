         <p align="justify">
            This game was developed from scratch for the final project for the course CSSE220: "Object-Oriented Software Development" during Winter 2013-2014. As a team of three, we implemented a "divide and conquer" technique to finish this game in four weeks while still learning Java Programming. This game has three levels, bonus points, extra items, etc. I mainly worked on the "enemies following" algorithm, and extra features such as, adding music and images for the game. Detailed documentation of the game can be found in my Github repository.
