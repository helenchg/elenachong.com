                This was my independent project based on Q. Wu et al. [1]. I made my own design with modified parameters for fabrication using equipment available at Rose-Hulman, and compared the simulated results with my measured results.
                <!-- ALSO YOU HAVE NO PLOTS COMPARING SIMULATED TO REAL RESULTS -->
