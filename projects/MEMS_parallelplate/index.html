         <strong>Project Overview</strong>

            <p>
                This project was part of a weekly lab assignment that walked us through the process of fabricating an array of MEMS heat actuators on silicon wafer. Me and my teammates conducted several testing throughout the process. The details of the fabrication process and testing is described in the MEMS Fabrication and Testing Report, which can be downloaded here:  <a href="/projects/MEMS_parallelplate/MEMS%20Heat%20Actuator%20Fabrication%20and%20Testing.pdf">[PDF]</a> <br> In Short, we learned how to perform wet oxidation to grow an oxide layer on a 500um, p-type, silicon wafer; to obtain a sacrificial layer through the process of photolitography, which I learned earlier through my independent research on growing carbon nanotubes; to deposit a 2um layer of aluminum with Electron Beam evapotation system (Physical Vapor Despotiion); how to perform wet chemical etching of aluminum, and how to remove sacrificial layer using oxygen plasma asher.
