         <strong>Project Overview</strong>

            <p align="justify">
This project was part of a lab assignment that walked us through the process of fabricating an array of MEMS heat actuators on silicon wafer. My teammates and I conducted several tests throughout the process. The details of the fabrication process and testing is described in the MEMS Fabrication and Testing Report, which can be downloaded here: <a href="/projects/MEMS_parallelplate/MEMS%20Heat%20Actuator%20Fabrication%20and%20Testing.pdf">[PDF]</a> <br> In Short, I learned several cleanroom processes through this project. Some of these processes include: wet oxidation on silicon wafers; patterned sacrificial layering of photoresist with photolithography; performing electron beam evaporation to deposit metals; wet chemical etching (we etched aluminum); and how to remove sacrificial layers using an oxygen plasma asher.
