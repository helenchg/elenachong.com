            <strong>Project Overview</strong> 
         </div>  
            <p align="justify">This was the research contribution done during my first quarter of undergraduate studies at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (fall 2012). I joined Dr. Richard Ditteon's team that worked on gathering and analyzing data from pictures of asteroids. My accomplishment here was to successfully measure the lightcurve of asteroids 2308 Schilt using 143 of 163 data points and 7213 Conae using 107 of 124 data points.  I also spent 10+ hours analyzing data from asteroids 1887 Virton, 560 Delila, and 7534 1995 UA7, but unfortunately failed to measure a good lightcurve from them. This research experience made me understand that even if we spend hours working on a problem, it does not always guarantee a good result.
