            During my summer 2014, I worked as an intern for Voxel8, a start-up company that came out of the Lewis Research Group at Harvard University. My job was to help develop a platform to print a tri-dimensional circuit. Over the course of 3 months, I designed, using SolidWorks, simple devices that consist of a plastic structure and conductive ink traces. I also tested a platform for 3D printing dual materials (PLA/ABS plastic + Conductive Ink) by working extensively with GCode, and helped fix and calibrate the first three 3D printer prototypes. I concluded my internship by 3D printing a tri-dimensional functional device with vertical conductive ink traces.
