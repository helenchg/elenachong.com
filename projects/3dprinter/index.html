         <strong>Project Overview</strong> <br>
             <p align="justify">While taking a break from my summer 2013 work, I read an article about 3D Printing from a magazine. Afterwards, I immediately went online to learn more about the technology and the how-to to build my own 3D printer. After learning about the reprap community, I ordered all the materials and 3D printed the parts needed to build the Prusa Menvel V2. Thanks to the help of the ECE department technician, I was able to assemble and calibrate the printer perfectly to produce good prints in two weeks. </p>
