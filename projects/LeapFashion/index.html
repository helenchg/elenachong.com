     <strong>Project Overview</strong> 
     </div>  
     <p>
         Upon arrival at the Hackaton, two of my best friends joined me as a team to build an LED dress that could be controlled via the internet by anyone who owned a Leap-Motion sensor. My partners (Man Chi Huen and Faye Li) worked with the data coming from the Leap-Motion sensor to produce different patterns and colors based on different hand gestures. I worked on the hardware part: configuring hardware communication of the Raspberry Pi with the LED strip, preparing the dress for the show, and setting up the raspberry pi connection for receiving the commands to control the LED dress. 
         36 hours later, we emerged as one of the HackIllinois 2015 winners. We were awarded the "Trunk Club's Most Innovative Way to Connect to Someone" prize.
