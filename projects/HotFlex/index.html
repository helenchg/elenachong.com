            While 3D printing offers great design flexibility before an
            object is printed, it is very hard for end-users to customize a
            3D-printed object to their specific needs after it is printed. We
            propose HotFlex: a new approach allowing precisely located
            parts of a 3D object to transition on demand from a solid into
            a deformable state and back. This approach enables intuitive
            hands-on remodeling, personalization, and customization of
            a 3D object after it is printed. We introduce the approach
            and present an implementation based on computer-controlled
            printed heating elements that are embedded within the 3D object.
            We present a set of functional patterns that act as building
            blocks and enable various forms of hands-on customization.
            Furthermore, we demonstrate how to integrate sensing
            of user input and visual output. A series of technical experiments
            and various application examples demonstrate the practical feasibility of the approach. <br>
                     My task involved creating proof-of-concepts and designing experiments for every primitive, pattern, and application described in our paper.
