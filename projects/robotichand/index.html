     <strong>Project Overview</strong> 
     </div>  
     <p>
This is my final project for the Mechatronics class. Me and my partner worked on it for a week. I mainly worked on the hardware and did a small amount of programming. My partner wrote the algorithm for the communication between the robotic hand and the glove. We used a Microchip microprocessor and programmed it with MPLAB using in C programming language.
