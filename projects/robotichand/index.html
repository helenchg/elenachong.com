             <strong>Project Overview</strong> 
        </div>  
             <p align="justify">
                 This glove-controlled robotic hand was the final project for my Mechatronics class at Rose-Hulman. Collaborating with a partner, we completed the project after a week of work. I primarily worked on the hardware and did a small amount of programming. My partner wrote the algorithm for the communication between the robotic hand and the glove. We used a Microchip microprocessor and programmed it with MPLAB using the C programming language.
