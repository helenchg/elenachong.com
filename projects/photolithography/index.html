         <strong>Project Overview</strong> 
         </div>  
            
            <p>This project was done as an independent research during Spring 2012-2013 term under the supervision of  Professor Dr. Kirkpatrick. The idea of this project was to grow a device, a single carbon nanotube, that can act as a traveling wave tube amplifier. My job was to improve the MEMS design using the integrated circuit design tool LASI7, and then perform photolithography to get an array of the device on a wafer.

            <strong>A Brief Description of the Photolithography Process</strong>
         <p align="justify">Several trials were made throughout the manufacturing process of the device. The one trial that gave good results is described as follows: <br>
             800nm of titanium and 10nm of silicon dioxide were deposited on a 500Î¼m silicon wafer using a PVD 75 machine. The wafer was then submerged in a dish with a dilute solution of 4 parts iron and 16 parts water for 10 minutes (this was to get a layer of iron nanoparticles for the growth of carbon nanotubes). Then, the wafer was laid on a baker at 95 celsius for one minute. After that, the wafer was spun on with photoresist and was exposed with the mask of device array, then baked again. The wafer was developed in a solution of 30mL developer with 90mL of distilled water to remove the excess photoresist, then rinsed with distilled water and spun to air dry. The unused titanium was etched in a standard solution of hydrofluoric acid, peroxide, and water for 5 seconds. Finally, the wafer was rinsed and spun again. Pictures of the process are shown below.
