             <strong>Project Overview</strong>

                    Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) is a type of brain machine interface (BMI) that enable direct communication pathways between the brain and an external device. The basic principle of this operation is that the electric signals from brain activity can be obtained using electrodes placed on the scalp, in a process known as electroencephalography (EEG). Acquired brain signals can be amplified, analyzed, and decoded to determine the intention of the user based on the user's visual fixation target. The objective of this project was to evaluate the performance of two different LED flashing patterns, and compare the performance of two analysis techniques: a simple averaging method, and canonical coherence analysis (CCA) method. <br>
                    My main task in this independent research was to help perform data gathering on human subjects. We affixed the EEG device to the human subject, and performed two experiments on them: they had to fixate their eyes on the LED matrix, and we displayed a checkerboard lighting pattern at different frequencies. Then, we took a short break and performed the second experiment with the All On/Off lighting pattern at different frequencies. We gathered all the data using MATLAB and stored them in a database for later analysis.
