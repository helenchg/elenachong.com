                This GUI can simulate the movement of a "plate loader" robot and can also control a physical "plate loader" robot in the lab.

                    Traveling is a very good cultural experience. If you can, you should plan to travel more often with family and friends. Even if you are traveling for work, check if you have a few free hours to visit the city and learn about the culture.

                This is a set of microwave devices that me and my two classmates designed and fabricated. It is a quadrature hybrid, single-box branchline coupler.

                    Project I worked on with two other Rose-Hulman students at my first Hackathon hosted by Norwestern University (WildHacks 2014). It was a very good experience. Got to prototype a concept in less than 24 hours.
